	abstract = {Linear model predictive control (MPC) can be currently deployed at outstanding speeds, thanks to recent progress in algorithms for solving online the underlying structured quadratic programs. In contrast, nonlinear MPC (NMPC) requires the deployment of more elaborate algorithms, which require longer computation times than linear MPC. Nonetheless, computational speeds for NMPC comparable to those of MPC are now regularly reported, provided that the adequate algorithms are used. In this paper, we aim at clarifying the similarities and differences between linear MPC and NMPC. In particular, we focus our analysis on NMPC based on the real-time iteration (RTI) scheme, as this technique has been successfully tested and, in some applications, requires computational times that are only marginally larger than linear MPC. The goal of the paper is to promote the understanding of RTI-based NMPC within the linear MPC community.},

Its interfaces to higher-level languages make it useful for quickly designing an optimization-based control algorithm by putting together different algorithmic components that can be readily connected and interchanged. Since the core of acados is written on top of a high-performance linear algebra library, we do not sacrifice computational performance. Thus, we aim to provide both flexibility and performance through modularity, without the need to rely on automatic code generation, which facilitates maintainability and extensibility. The main features of acados are: efficient optimal control algorithms targeting embedded devices implemented in C, linear algebra based on the high-performance BLASFEO library, user-friendly interfaces to Matlab and Python, and compatibility with the modeling language of CasADi. acados is free and open-source software released under the permissive BSD 2-Clause license.},

In order to formulate the nonlinear model predictive control problem, different coordinate systems can be used with different advantages. We propose and compare formulations for the nonlinear MPC related optimization problem, involving a Cartesian and a Frenet coordinate frame in a single nonlinear program. We specify costs and collision avoidance constraints in the more advantageous coordinate frame, derive appropriate formulations and compare different obstacle constraints. With this approach, we exploit the simpler formulation of opponent vehicle constraints in the Cartesian coordinate frame, as well as road-aligned costs and constraints related to the Frenet coordinate frame. Comparisons to other approaches in a simulation framework highlight the advantages of the proposed methods.},

Their designs are based on an extended kinematic one-track model, and they provide a smooth, singularity-free stopping transient. With regard to autonomous test applications, the proposed tracking law without orientation control performs much better with respect to control effort and steering-input saturation than the one with orientation control but needs to be prudently combined with the latter for backward driving. The controller performance is illustrated with a full-size test vehicle.},

Seeking time-optimality, while guaranteeing the integrity of time-varying spatial bounds, is an appealing trade-off for agile vehicles, such as quadrotors. State-of-the-art approaches, either assume bounds to be static and generate time-optimal trajectories offline, or compromise time-optimality for constraint satisfaction. Leveraging nonlinear model predictive control and a path parametric reformulation of the quadrotor model, we present a real-time control that approximates time-optimal behavior and remains within dynamic corridors. The efficacy of the approach is evaluated by simulated results, showing itself capable of performing extremely aggressive maneuvers as well as stop-and-go and backward motions.

	abstract = {The advances in computer processor technology have enabled the application of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to agile systems, such as quadrotors. These systems are characterized by their underactuation, nonlinearities, bounded inputs, and time-delays. Classical control solutions fall short in overcoming these difficulties and fully exploiting the capabilities offered by such platforms. This paper presents the design and implementation of an efficient position controller for quadrotors based on real-time NMPC with time-delay compensation and bounds enforcement on the actuators. To deal with the limited computational resources onboard, an offboard control architecture is proposed. It is implemented using the high-performance software package acados, which solves optimal control problems and implements a real-time iteration (RTI) variant of a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) scheme with Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation. The quadratic subproblems (QP) in the SQP scheme are solved with HPIPM, an interior-point method solver, built on top of the linear algebra library BLASFEO, finely tuned for multiple CPU architectures. Solution times are further reduced by reformulating the QPs using the efficient partial condensing algorithm implemented in HPIPM. We demonstrate the capabilities of our architecture using the Crazyflie 2.1 nano-quadrotor.},

A key difference with respect to existing high-performance implementations of BLAS is that the computational performance is optimized for small to medium scale matrices, i.e., for sizes up to a few hundred. BLASFEO comes with three different implementations: a high-performance implementation aiming at providing the highest performance for matrices fitting in cache, a reference implementation providing portability and embeddability and optimized for very small matrices, and a wrapper to standard BLAS and LAPACK providing high-performance on large matrices. The three implementations of BLASFEO together provide high-performance dense linear algebra routines for matrices ranging from very small to large. Compared to both open-source and proprietary highly-tuned BLAS libraries, for matrices of size up to about one hundred the high-performance implementation of BLASFEO is about 20-30\% faster than the corresponding level 3 BLAS routines and 2-3 times faster than the corresponding LAPACK routines.},

Non-smooth obstacle shapes, such as rectangles, introduce additional local minima in the underlying optimization problem. Smooth over-approximations, e.g., ellipsoidal shapes, limit the performance due to their conservativeness. We propose to vary the smoothness and the related over-approximation by a homotopy. Instead of varying the smoothness in consecutive sequential quadratic programming iterations, we use formulations that decrease the smooth over-approximation from the end towards the beginning of the prediction horizon. Thus, the real-time iterations algorithm is applicable to the proposed NMPC formulation. Different formulations are compared in simulation experiments and shown to successfully improve performance indicators without increasing the computation time.},
