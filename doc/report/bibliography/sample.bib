	abstract = {Linear model predictive control (MPC) can be currently deployed at outstanding speeds, thanks to recent progress in algorithms for solving online the underlying structured quadratic programs. In contrast, nonlinear MPC (NMPC) requires the deployment of more elaborate algorithms, which require longer computation times than linear MPC. Nonetheless, computational speeds for NMPC comparable to those of MPC are now regularly reported, provided that the adequate algorithms are used. In this paper, we aim at clarifying the similarities and differences between linear MPC and NMPC. In particular, we focus our analysis on NMPC based on the real-time iteration (RTI) scheme, as this technique has been successfully tested and, in some applications, requires computational times that are only marginally larger than linear MPC. The goal of the paper is to promote the understanding of RTI-based NMPC within the linear MPC community.},

Thus, we aim to provide both flexibility and performance through modularity, without the need to rely on automatic code generation, which facilitates maintainability and extensibility. The main features of acados are: efficient optimal control algorithms targeting embedded devices implemented in C, linear algebra based on the high-performance BLASFEO library, user-friendly interfaces to Matlab and Python, and compatibility with the modeling language of CasADi. acados is free and open-source software released under the permissive BSD 2-Clause license.},

We specify costs and collision avoidance constraints in the more advantageous coordinate frame, derive appropriate formulations and compare different obstacle constraints. With this approach, we exploit the simpler formulation of opponent vehicle constraints in the Cartesian coordinate frame, as well as road-aligned costs and constraints related to the Frenet coordinate frame.

A key difference with respect to existing high-performance implementations of BLAS is that the computational performance is optimized for small- to medium-scale matrices, i.e., for sizes up to a few hundred. BLASFEO comes with three different implementations: a high-performance implementation aimed at providing the highest performance for matrices fitting in cache, a reference implementation providing portability and embeddability and optimized for very small matrices, and a wrapper to standard BLAS and LAPACK providing high performance on large matrices. The three implementations of BLASFEO together provide high-performance dense linear algebra routines for matrices ranging from very small to large. Compared to both open-source and proprietary highly tuned BLAS libraries, for matrices of size up to about 100, the high-performance implementation of BLASFEO is about 20--30\% faster than the corresponding level 3 BLAS routines and two to three times faster than the corresponding LAPACK routines.},

	abstract = {Many practical applications lead to optimization problems that can either be stated as quadratic programming (QP) problems or require the solution of QP problems on a lower algorithmic level. One relatively recent approach to solve QP problems are parametric active-set methods that are based on tracing the solution along a linear homotopy between a QP problem with known solution and the QP problem to be solved. This approach seems to make them particularly suited for applications where a-priori information can be used to speed-up the QP solution or where high solution accuracy is required. In this paper we describe the open-source C++ software package qpOASES, which implements a parametric active-set method in a reliable and efficient way. Numerical tests show that qpOASES can outperform other popular academic and commercial QP solvers on small- to medium-scale convex test examples of the Maros-Mészáros QP collection. Moreover, various interfaces to third-party software packages make it easy to use, even on embedded computer hardware. Finally, we describe how qpOASES can be used to compute critical points of nonconvex QP problems.},

Mostly the center line of the road is used as a transformation curve, but the choice of the transformation curve might have properties which make the optimization problem hard or even infeasible to solve in the whole search space. This paper proposes an optimization-based parameterization approach to establish an alternative transformation curve which yields favorable numerical properties for the consecutive use of numerical optimization approaches such as MPC. The optimization objective minimizes the change of curvature and pushes the evolute (i.e. singular region) of the transformation curve outside the feasible region. The convergence improvement of the proposed parameterization approach in terms of integrator precision, optimization time and iteration counts is compared in simulation examples, using a time-optimal nonlinear optimization formulation.},

Nevertheless, such frame is not friendly for describing vehicle-related characteristics such as body shape and classical dynamic models. By contrast, the Cartesian frame facilitates straightforward modeling of vehicle dynamics, but confronts nonconvex constraints on curving lanes. For purpose of combining the complementary superiority of both frames, this letter proposes a joint Cartesian-Frenét MPC planning method based on a locally linear intermediary connection which is updated along with solving iterations. The augmented Cartesian-Frenét state space is constrained by a Cartesian vehicle control model that stands for tracking feasibility, a set of Frenét road constraints that account for driving safety, and a Cartesian-Frenét transformation that connects both frames. The final optimization is solved iteratively, where each iteration formulates into a quadratic programming problem with help of the apriori trajectory solved by the previous iteration. A comparative simulation and a 5-month-long real-vehicle test prove that the proposed method can produce a feasible and smooth trajectory within a safe area efficiently in complex real-world scenarios.},

The objectives considered in the trajectory optimization include but are not limited to the overall path length, trajectory execution time, separation from obstacles, passing through intermediate way points and compliance with the robots dynamic, kinematic and geometric constraints. “Timed elastic bands” explicitly consider spatial-temporal aspects of the motion in terms of dynamic constraints such as limited robot velocities and accelerations. The trajectory planning operates in real time such that “timed elastic bands” cope with dynamic obstacles and motion constraints. The “timed elastic band problem” is formulated as a scalarized multi-objective optimization problem. Most objectives are local and relate to only a small subset of parameters as they only depend on a few consecutive robot states. This local structure results in a sparse system matrix, which allows the utilization of fast and efficient optimization techniques such as the open-source framework “g2o” for solving “timed elastic band” problems. The “g2o” sparse system solvers have been successfully applied to VSLAM problems. This contribution describes the application and adaptation of the g2o-framework in the context of trajectory modification with the “timed elastic band”. Results from simulations and experiments with a real robot demonstrate that the implementation is robust and computationally efficient.},

The proposed MPC optimizes the planning and control goals within one optimization problem using a dynamical model. The first element of the computed optimal decision sequence at any time instant can be applied directly to the vehicle, and an additional tracking controller is not required. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated in both static and dynamic obstacle scenarios within the high-fidelity CarSim simulation environment. The results show that the proposed algorithm can compute the control actions in real-time, and the vehicle can drive safely and smoothly amid static and dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the proposed approach outperforms the potential field method in terms of computational complexity and planning cost, and the MPC-based planner with kinematics in the high driving speed cases.},

These systems are characterized by their underactuation, nonlinearities, bounded inputs, and time-delays. Classical control solutions fall short in overcoming these difficulties and fully exploiting the capabilities offered by such platforms. This paper presents the design and implementation of an efficient position controller for quadrotors based on real-time NMPC with time-delay compensation and bounds enforcement on the actuators. To deal with the limited computational resources onboard, an offboard control architecture is proposed. It is implemented using the high-performance software package acadoff, which solves optimal control problems and implements a real-time iteration (RTI) variant of a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) scheme with Gauss-Newton Hessian approximation. The quadratic subproblems (QP) in the SQP scheme are solved with HPIPM, an interior-point method solver, built on top of the linear algebra library BLASFEO, finely tuned for multiple CPU architectures. Solution times are further reduced by reformulating the QPs using the efficient partial condensing algorithm implemented in HPIPM. We demonstrate the capabilities of our architecture using the Crazyflie 2.1 nano-quadrotor.},

Then, the estimated system parameter is employed in MPC to improve the prediction accuracy. In the proposed ALMPC scheme, a robustness constraint is introduced into the MPC optimization to handle parametric and additive uncertainties. For the designed robustness constraint, its shape is decided off-line based on the invariant set, whereas its shrinkage rate is updated online according to the estimated upper bound of the estimation error, leading to further reduced conservatism and slightly increased computational complexity compared with the robust MPC methods. Furthermore, it is theoretically shown that the proposed ALMPC algorithm is recursively feasible under some derived conditions, and the closed-loop system is input-to-state stable (ISS). Finally, a numerical example and comparison study are conducted to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

Simulated experiment results reflect that an amount of 5\% reduction in the planning time has been achieved and the velocity curve implies that the operation was relatively smooth.

Their designs are based on an extended kinematic one-track model, and they provide a smooth, singularity-free stopping transient. With regard to autonomous test applications, the proposed tracking law without orientation control performs much better with respect to control effort and steering-input saturation than the one with orientation control but needs to be prudently combined with the latter for backward driving.
